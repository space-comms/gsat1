# LUCIA Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)

## Purpose

The ADCS is responsible for determining and controlling the orientation of the satellite in space.

## Sensors

- Magnetometers
- Gyroscopes
- Sun sensors

## Actuators

- Magnetorquers (electromagnetic rods)
- Reaction wheels (for precise pointing, if mission requires)

## Algorithms

- Sensor fusion for attitude determination
- Control loops for actuation (e.g., PID controllers)

## Modes

- Detumble (stabilization after deployment)
- Sun-pointing or nadir-pointing (for payload operations)
- Safe mode (minimal power consumption)
