# LUCIA Communications System

## Overview

Communications is vital for commanding the satellite and downloading data. LUCIA uses amateur radio bands for its primary link.

## Components

- **Transceiver:** UHF/VHF or S-band radio modules, depending on data rate requirements.
- **Antenna:** Deployable monopole or dipole, stowed for launch.
- **Ground Station:** University-based ground station with tracking antennas, rotators, and SDR (Software Defined Radio).

## Protocols

- **Telemetry:** AX.25 or custom packet format.
- **Command Uplink:** Secure, error-checked command protocol.
- **Downlink Data:** Telemetry, payload data, health status.

## Regulatory

- Licensing through Ofcom (UK) or ITU as required.
- Adherence to International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) coordination.

## Testing

- RF link budget analysis.
- Antenna deployment and SWR testing.
- End-to-end ground-to-space communication simulations.
