# LUCIA Power System (EPS)

## Power Generation

- **Solar Panels:** High-efficiency triple-junction GaAs cells mounted on exterior faces. For a 1U CubeSat, expect 2-4 sides covered.
- **Deployable Panels:** For higher power missions, deployable solar arrays can be considered.

## Power Storage

- **Batteries:** Lithium-polymer or lithium-ion cells sized to match mission duration and eclipse periods. Includes protection circuitry for safety.

## Power Management

- **Power Distribution Board (PDB):** Regulates and routes power to all subsystems, includes monitoring for voltage/current.
- **Energy Budgeting:** Analysis of power generation vs. consumption during all mission phases (day/night, active/safe modes).

## Key Considerations

- Battery heating during charging/discharging cycles.
- Redundancy and fault-tolerance in regulation circuits.
