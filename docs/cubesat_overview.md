# CubeSat and G-Sat ("Gryphon Satellite") Overview

## What is a CubeSat?

A **CubeSat** is a standardized nanosatellite platform, initially developed to facilitate low-cost access to space for universities and researchers. The basic unit (1U) is a 10x10x10 cm cube, typically weighing up to 1.33 kg. CubeSats can be built in multiples of this unit (e.g., 2U, 3U, 6U) to accommodate more complex missions.

**Key features:**
- Modular, stackable design
- Use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components
- Deployed with standardized launchers (P-POD, NanoRacks, etc.)
- Used for education, technology demonstration, Earth observation, and science

## The G-Sat Mission

### Mission Statement

G-Sat (Gryphon Satellite) is Leeds Universityâ€™s flagship CubeSat project, aiming to:
- Demonstrate the complete development and launch of a 1U CubeSat
- Deliver a scientific or engineering payload to low Earth orbit
- Document every step openly for educational purposes

### Project Phases

1. **Concept & Feasibility**
   - Identify mission goals, such as Earth imaging or communications.
   - Analyze requirements, constraints, and risks.
2. **Design & Simulation**
   - Develop system architecture, select components.
   - Simulate orbital mechanics, thermal profiles, and power budgets.
3. **Prototype & Test**
   - Build engineering models, validate with bench tests.
   - Environmental testing (vibration, thermal-vacuum).
4. **Integration & Launch**
   - Final assembly, compliance with launch provider.
   - Launch coordination, licensing, and deployment.
5. **Operations**
   - Ground station setup, satellite commissioning, data collection.
