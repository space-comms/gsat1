# LUCIA Payload

# Payload Overview:

The payload integrates advanced sensor technology optimized for small satellite platforms.

Data collected will be transmitted to ground stations for processing and analysis.

Results will be shared openly to support environmental policy and community awareness.

## Purpose

Our CubeSat payload is designed to monitor and analyze air quality and urban heat islands across the city of Leeds. By collecting high-resolution environmental data from space, we aim to provide valuable insights into urban climate patterns, pollution hotspots, and their impacts on public health and urban planning.

## Objectives:

Deploy sensors capable of detecting key air pollutants (e.g., NO2, PM2.5) and temperature variations.

Map urban heat islands to understand how different areas of Leeds experience temperature extremes.

Collaborate with local authorities, researchers, and communities to apply data for sustainable urban development.

Contribute to the scientific understanding of urban environmental challenges through space-based observations.

## Functions:
- Low-resolution Earth imaging camera
- Radiation or environmental sensors
- Amateur radio repeater or digipeater

## Integration

- Payload must fit within allocated mass, volume, and power budgets.
- Interface definition with OBC for data collection and command.

## Data Handling

- Onboard processing to compress or filter data.
- Telemetry downlink or onboard storage for later download.

## Example: Earth Observation

- Camera specification: CMOS, <2MP, wide-angle lens.
- Data pipeline: Image capture -> onboard encoding -> downlink via UHF/S-band.
